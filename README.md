# NetPractice

## Project overview

The project is about configuring small-networks. As a general practice exercise, the networks have issues to be fix, and so, make them run correctly. There are 10 levels to complete in order to finish the project. Examples of successfully completed levels are available on `my_config`

## NetPractice - Project

To succeed in the exercises, the unshaded fields must be updated until the network configuration is properly communicating. For each level, a non-functioning network diagram will be provided as an example, which I will use to explain my implementation of the exercises in the sections below.
