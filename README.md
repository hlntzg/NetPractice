# NetPractice

## Project overview

The project involves configuring small networks. As a general exercise, each network has issues that need to be fixed in order to ensure proper functionality. There are 10 levels to complete in order to finish the project. Examples of successfully completed levels can be found in the `my_config` directory.

## NetPractice - Project

To succeed in the exercises, the unshaded fields must be updated until the network configuration is properly communicating. For each level, a non-functioning network diagram will be provided as an example, which I will use to explain my implementation of the exercises in the sections below.
